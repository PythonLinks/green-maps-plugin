Here are the instructions I gave to DeepSeek to write this plugin. 
Please build me a WordPress Plugin called “Green Party Maps”. It should be a single file.   The plugin should create a short code, which fetches the json data from https://GreenMaps.us/usa/geojson.    When this plugin is activated, it registers the short code. When the plugin is activated it checks to see if a page called “green-party-maps” exists.  If it exists, the plugin makes sure that the page is in the “published” state.  If the page does not yet exist,  the plugin creates a page, not a post, with slug “green-party-maps”.  The created page should include that short code,  such that when the page is displayed, the short code is executed, the remote data is fetched and displayed on the page  in a <pre> tag.  When a page is displayed, if the page slug is 
“green-party-maps” the plugin should inject the following html into the page header: “<!—  Code to be injected. —>”.  That html should not be injected into any other pages or posts.  Later I will edit it to inject the correct javascript.   This plugin, when deactivated, will check  if the page “green-party-maps” exists.  If it exists, it will change the page state from “published” to “draft”  Please state in the comments that the plugin is in the public domain.
